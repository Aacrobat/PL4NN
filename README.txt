Perceptual Losses for Neural Networks (PL4NN)

A Caffe implementation of the perceptual loss functions described in the paper:
"Loss Functions for Neural Networks for Image Processing", Hang Zhao, Orazio Gallo, Iuri Frosio, and Jan Kautz, IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging, 2017.

Assuming that CAFFE_ROOT is Caffe's installation folder:

1) Copy loss.py to $CAFFE_ROOT/python
2) Add $CAFFE_ROOT/python to your Python path
